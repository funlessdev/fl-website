## Contribute to FunLess

ðŸ‘‰ The FunLess code lives in the [`funlessdev` organization](https://github.com/funlessdev/)

We have several repositories for the different parts of the system, with a lot of stuff to do.

If you want to partecipate and have fun with Elixir, Rust, Go, WebAssembly and Serverless you are very welcome!

You can contribute in many different ways. Either help us design the system, contribute code, open issues, write documentation 
or just use FunLess for something!

Our workflow is to fork a repo, work on it and open a Pull Request. Each PR has to pass all the checks and have at least 1 approval 
from a reviewer. 

The way to get started is opening issues:

- If you want to work on something or have any comments, just open an issue on the [main repo](https://github.com/funlessdev/funless).

- If it is related to the cli and Go ---> [repo here](https://github.com/funlessdev/fl-cli). 

- If you want to add docs and content to this website ---> [repo here](https://github.com/funlessdev/fl-website)
