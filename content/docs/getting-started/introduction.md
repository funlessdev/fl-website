FunLess includes capabilities for building and deploying applications from source, composed of stateless functions, that can scale automatically. Connect events from external systems that can trigger function invocations and create workflows by pipelining your functions. 

All of this easily deployed over Kubernetes or Nomad, or standalone, with the simple-to-use command line tool.

Under the hood, FunLess takes advantage of several modern technologies like Elixir, Rust and WebAssembly to provide a light, secure and fast experience to run your serverless applications.

Our goal is to provide a new FaaS platform to take advantage of modern technologies, ease of deployment and learn new things!
