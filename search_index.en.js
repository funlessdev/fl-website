Core plays two separate roles in FunLess' architecture:\n\nIt's the main entrypoint, that is, it handles all requests coming from the outside\nIt's the platform's central scheduler, and dispatches each function invocation to an appropriate worker\n\nIn a way, communication within FunLess can be separated according to these roles: it either goes from the user to the Core, or from the Core to the Workers.\nAs the entrypoint\nThe Core contains an HTTP server, developed using the Phoenix framework. It exposes a REST API, which allow users to perform CRUD operations on several entities1.\nWhen a function is created, the Core also forwards its code to all Workers, to mitigate potential cold starts caused by network delays. Workers are also notified when functions are updated (prompting them to replace their version of the code with a new one) or deleted (prompting them to remove the function's code from their local storage).\nAs the scheduler\nThe Core also acts as the scheduler of the platform, that is, it forwards each invocation request to a suitable worker.\nTo give a very simple description of the workflow of an invocation:\n\nThe Core receives a POST request to invoke a certain function\nThe function's definition is retrieved from the database\nThe Core retrieves all known Workers in the cluster\nThe Core retrieves metrics for all these Workers\nThe metrics are used to select the Worker that will receive the function, according to a specific policy \n\nSince step 4 might fail (if, e.g., no metrics have ever been retrieved for any Worker ever because of network issues), if no metrics are retrieved, a random Worker is selected, regardless of the scheduling policy. This is of course a last resort to avoid invocation failure, and might be subject to change in the future (if we find invocation failure to be a more reliable/sound approach).\nThe default policy, as of right now, is to select the Worker with the highest amount of memory available.\nPolicies\nFunLess is built to accept different scheduling policies, depending on the associated configuration to each function. This means that it's relatively easy to extend the Core with a new policy, provided that an implementation is provided for the SchedulingPolicy protocol (and therefore, an appropriate data type for the relevant configuration).\nPolicies are simply functions with the following signature:\n$$\n(t, [Worker], Function) \\rightarrow Worker\n$$\nWhere \\(t\\) is the configuration type, and \\([Worker]\\) means a list of \"enriched\" Workers. Therefore, a policy simply returns a Worker, given a configuration, the available nodes, and the function being invoked.\n\n1\nCurrently functions, modules and configuration scripts.\n\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/core/","title":"Core"},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/entities/":{"body":"Functions\nModules\nScheduling Policies\nConfiguration Scripts\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/entities/","title":"Entities"},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/overview/":{"body":"FunLess' skeleton\nThe architecture of FunLess consists of several components:\n\nThe Core, acting both and as the platform's entrypoint and scheduler. The Core handles all incoming HTTP requests and forwards each invocation to an available node1.\nThe Workers, acting as function executors. Each Worker embeds a WebAssembly runtime and is responsible for running functions and recovering their results. Workers communicate with the Core to handle invocation requests. Moreover, each Worker holds the code for several functions in a local cache, reducing cold starts.\nA database (currently Postgres), holding all function information1. The database is co-located on the same node as the Core, to minimise communication latency between the two2. \nA monitoring system (currently Prometheus), scraping metrics from the Workers. The Core periodically queries the monitoring system to retrieve updated information on each Worker's resource usage and status. Like the database, this component is also co-located with the Core2.\n\nLife of a request\nA very simple representation of how FunLess processes requests can be seen in the following diagram:\n\n\nFollowing the diagram, a function creation requests generally consists of four steps:\n\nThe user sends a request to the Core to create a function\nThe function is stored in the database\nThe Core sends the function's code to all connected Workers\nEach Worker saves the code as-is in its local storage (whether in-memory or on a persistent medium)3\n\nAn invocation requests, on the other hand, follows this path:\n\n\nThe user sends an invocation request for a function\n\n\nThe Core retrieves the function definition from the database\n\n\nThe Core selects a Worker to run the function, and forwards to it the invocation request\n\n\nThe Worker searches its cache for the function's code\n\n\nAt this point, the execution branches in two different cases:\n\n9a: The function's code is found. The Worker runs the function, and returns its result to the Core. The workflow terminates here.\n9b: The function's code is not found locally. The Worker sends a \"no code\" message to the Core\n\n\n\nIf the \"b\" path was taken in step 9, the request proceeds:\n\nThe Core sends the same request as before to the Worker, adding the function's code this time\nThe Worker caches the function's code, after a pre-compilation phase3 (more on that on the Worker description)\nThe Worker runs the function, and returns its result to the Core. The workflow terminates here.\n\nNote on connectivity\nAs of right now, FunLess relies on the libcluster library to automatically connect all nodes in a single cluster, whether on top of an orchestrator or not. That being said, it is still possible to manually connect nodes to the cluster using the Node.connect function of the Elixir language. The nodes must be visible to each other without NAT to ensure the communication works4.\n\n1\nAt the time of writing, FunLess only supports single-Core deployments. Support for multiple cores is being worked on. In such deployments, both the database and the metric system would probably be replicated and co-located with each Core instance.\n\n2\nFunLess does not currently support multi-tenancy, therefore the database only contains information about functions and modules. User information will be handled generally in the same way.\n\n3\nFor simplicity, the distinction between storing the code as-is and cache the pre-compiled code is not shown in the diagram. In case the pre-compiled code is not found, but the \"raw\" code is already in storage, the Worker simply performs the pre-compilation step and caches the result, without talking to the Core. The \"raw\" code is never used for function invocation, only the pre-compiled version is.\n\n4\nA more thorough guide on how to configure the network and deploy FunLess without an orchestrator can be found here.\n\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/overview/","title":"Overview"},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/worker/":{"body":"The Worker is the main function executor of the FunLess platform. In a standard deployment, there normally are as many Workers as the total number of nodes (potentially minus one, if the Core node is not used as an executor).\nEach Worker embeds a WebAssembly runtime (currently Wasmtime), to instantiate and run functions. Each function is a WebAssembly module, with the addition of the several imports/exports (see below).\nFunLess-compatible WebAssembly modules\nAs of right now, standard WebAssembly modules are not runnable by FunLess (and vice-versa, FunLess-compatible modules are not runnable by standalone runtimes), because of several requirements in terms of imported and exported functions. We list here the required imports/exports the module must satisfy.\nTo produce FunLess-compatible modules, we currently use language-specific wrappers, which can be found in a dedicated repository. This approach is subject to change and we plan on greatly improving the usability of the platform, by integrating the building process with our CLI and increasing compatibility with standard WebAssembly modules.\nImported functions\n\n\n__get_input_data asks the runtime to write the input data to memory. It takes a single integer as input, representing the pointer where the data will be written.\n\n\n__insert_response inserts the function's response in memory. It takes two integers as input, representing the pointer to the response, and its length.\n\n\n__insert_error same as __insert_response, used in case the function encountered an error.\n\n\n__http_request performs an HTTP request, with a JSON body and a JSON response. Takes several parameters, in the following order:\n\npointer to the response and pointer to its length, which will be populated by the runtime after the request is performed\npointer to the status, also populated by the runtime\nmethod (an integer from 0 to 3, representing GET, POST, PUT and DELETE in this order)\npointer and length of the URL\npointer and length of the headers, codified as a string\npointer and length of the body\n\nThis function will probably be scrapped, as the WASI standard has recenly included HTTP requests and socket operations, so there will be no need for a custom import.\n\n\n__console_log is a debugging function, to be removed in the future (or at least disabled in production environments). Prints the given string (identified by two integers, a pointer to the message and its length) as a debugging log on the Worker. \n\n\nExported functions\n\n__invoke is used by FunLess to actually run the module. This function basically extracts the input from memory using __get_input_data, runs the main function (or its equivalent) in the given language, and inserts the results in memory using __insert_response or __insert_error. __invoke takes a single integer as argument, representing the length of the function's input (generally stringified JSON).\n\nWhen loading the input data, the general workflow is:\n\ninitialize an array of length N, where N is the parameter passed to __invoke\ncall __get_input_data with a pointer to the array\nparse the array as a string\npass the string to the main function (the actual user-defined function)\n\n__invoke also returns either 0 or 1, for success and failure respectively, after having called __insert_response (or __insert_error).\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/worker/","title":"Worker"},"https://funless.dev/docs/contributing/":{"body":"","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/contributing/","title":"Contributing"},"https://funless.dev/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/":{"body":"Contribute to FunLess\n👉 The FunLess code lives in the funlessdev organization\nWe have several repositories for the different parts of the system, with a lot of stuff to do.\nIf you want to partecipate and have fun with Elixir, Rust, Go, WebAssembly and Serverless you are very welcome!\nYou can contribute in many different ways.

We will use Rust. From a folder of your choosing, run:\n\n\nThis will download the template folder which contains the Rust and Javascript templates, and use the Rust template\nto create a new project named hello. The folder hello will contain a Cargo.toml and a lib.rs with the fl_main function, \nwhich you can fill with your code.\nThe template function takes a json of the form {\"name\": \"FunLess\"} and returns a {\"payload\": \"Hello FunLess\"}. You can change it to your liking.\nNow you can build and deploy it to FunLess. The create subcommand will take care of both building and uploading.\n\nThe first argument of the create subcommand is the name of the function inside FunLess, the second is the path to the directory with the code. There are other commands like build that only builds the wasm file and saves it, upload that takes a wasm file and uses it to create a function in the platform. The create command is a combination of both, but after the function creation it deletes the wasm file so your pc stays clean. At last the --language is the programming language of the code.\nIn FunLess  each function is part of a module (you can think of them as namespaces from the C family of languages, or packages). \nEvery FunLess instance has a default _ module, so if you don't create a new module (with the mod subcommand) and specify it when creating functions, they will be created in the _ module. You can get info about a module with its list of function with:\n\n\nInvoke it\nNow you can invoke it. Since the function takes a json argument, you can use the -j flag to pass the JSON object with the 'name' key as input: \n\nIf everything worked correctly, the invocation request will be received by the core component, passed to the worker componend and the wasm\nfunction will be executed. The result will be returned to the core component and then to the CLI, which will print it to the console.\n\nDelete it\nYou can delete the function with:\n\nCleaning up\nWhen you are done, you can remove the containers and cleanup the dev deployment with:\n\n\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start"},"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/":{"body":"","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/","title":"Roadmap"},"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/roadmap/":{"body":"2023 Roadmap\nThese are the expected milestones for this year. \nThe plan is subject to change as this is still an experimental platform, \nthe purpose of which is first and foremost to assist in our research work. \nBecause of this, usability and frontend-focused additions may fall behind in priority compared to research-driven features \n(e.g. scheduling optimization).\nQ1\n\n\nAuthentication &amp; Authorization\n\nHTTP requests from wasm functions\n\nFunctional Kubernetes deployment\n\nBenchmarks and comparison with other OSS serverless platforms\n\nSmall slack bot demo\n\nQ2\n\n\nTopology-aware scheduling\n\nMulti-core deployments with reverse-proxy\n\nNats connector/data sink\n\nOpenTelemetry integration setup\n\nHelm chart\n\nBenchmarks with multi-core scenarios\n\nQ3\n\n\nCustom scheduling policies\n\nWeb functions\n\nFunction workflows\n\nKafka connector/data sink\n\nMore OpenTelemetry/Metrics \n\nBare-metal deployment with ansible\n\nSmall web functions demo\n\nQ4\n\n\nAdmin &amp; Playground interface\n\nWasm functions registry\n\nUtility library to develop functions\n\nNomad deployment\n\nSupport more languages\n\nPostgres connector/data-sink\n\nWeb site demo made with FunLess\n\nBeyond\n\nLow-Code platform\nMore connectors/data-sinks (Amazon S3, MySql, Google Cloud Storage...)\nBetter Kubernetes integration with CRDs/Secrets/etc\n\n","id":"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/roadmap/","title":"Roadmap"},"https://funless.dev/privacy-policy/":{"body":"TLDR: We do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data.\nWebsite visitors\n\nNo personal information is collected.\nNo information is stored in the browser.\nNo information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties.\nNo information is shared with advertising companies.\nNo information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends.\nNo information is monetized.\n\nContact us\nContact us if you have any questions.\n","id":"https://funless.dev/privacy-policy/","title":"Privacy Policy"}},"docInfo":{"https://funless.dev/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/authors/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/authors/giuseppe-de-palma/":{"body":3,"title":3},"https://funless.dev/authors/matteo-trentin/":{"body":3,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/core/":{"body":240,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/entities/":{"body":6,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/overview/":{"body":368,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/architecture/worker/":{"body":295,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/contributing/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/":{"body":80,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/bare-metal/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":109,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/kubernetes/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/nomad/":{"body":1,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start/":{"body":305,"title":2},"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/docs/roadmap/roadmap/":{"body":135,"title":1},"https://funless.dev/privacy-policy/":{"body":35,"title":2}},"length":22},"lang":"English"};
